2a. When to Suspend
Any violation of the guidelines should always result in a suspension (usually 7 days). 
Read below for more details.

You should also suspend even if the violation was unintentional, but you should try to explain to them if you can. It's important for people to know what they did wrong so that they can change.

Lastly, you should increase the suspension duration for repeat offenses (1 day goes to a 3 day ban, 3 days to 7 days, 7 to 14, 14 to 30, and 30 to a permanent ban).
2b. How long should I suspend for?
Guidelines Violations
In general, any violation of the guidelines is a 7-day ban, and it should increase for repeat offenses.

You should especially watch out for guidelines 2, 3, and 4, which also include the following (if it wasn't clear already):
Death threats or wishing harm (e.g. saying "kys")
Bullying/harassing players (verbally or through action)
Any racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or discrimination in general
Mass reporting people for no apparent reason with malicious intentions
Saying any of the following slurs / offensive terms (or baiting them)
For just a few examples, this includes: n-word (including niglet), f-slur (faggot/fag), r-slur (retard/retarded), trans slur (tranny), racial slurs (such as cracker, beaner, ching chong, gypsy, chink, paki, curry muncher), hate towards women (whore, slut, slag)

¹It doesn't matter whether they "meant it" or whether it was a joke, unless it falls under this specific exception, we will not tolerate any of it
² Users are responsible for their account, anything that comes from their mic is subject to the guidelines, even if it was a family member or a friend.
³ Users are warned that it’s their last ban before a permanent when they get a 30-day ban.
Extra Cases
Permanent Ban
Evading a ban by playing on an alternate account should increase the existing ban (7, 14, 30) and have the alternate account permabanned
Underage if the user is younger than 10 years old
For users between 10 - 12, they must have a parent-managed account, otherwise, it's a ban.
Hacking / Client Mods is a permaban and also contact the devs
30 Days Ban
Offensive building is 30 days
Any slur or inappropriate map, nazi/hate/terrorist stuff
Supporting a terrorist organization starts at 30 days
Others
Destroying builds is not bannable by default, but intentionally following a specific player around solely to grief or bully them is if it reaches the point of targeting or harassment - ban for 7 days
Pedophilia jokes/comments are a 7-day ban, unless it is serious then issue a permanent ban (must have proof) and contact Renan so they can escalate to authorities.
Creative Griefing, maliciously destroying other users builds in creative mode is considered griefing and ban starts at 3 days - also applies to paint griefing
Pasting Lag Maps starts at 3 days, same for creating lag machines.
Offensive / Inappropriate display names start at 1 day unless it is a slur which you ban for 7 days (tell them to change it as well)
Impersonating a mod should be a 1-day ban (if it's serious), or a warning if not
Abusing bugs/exploits for an advantage may be a ban, but you should contact the devs always (except in Lab, just tell the user to report the bug and how to replicate it)
English or Spanish Trend should be bannable (7d) only if the user continues it with a homophobic tone.
Applying for roles while being underaged If a player applies for labrat or cc while being of the age of 10-12 (or 13 for moderator) it should be a 14d ban (if they don’t have a pma account or if they’re under 10 they should receive a permanent ban).

¹If the user is banned for 30 days for pasting an inappropriate map and gets permanently banned for something unrelated, ask a senior mod to override it.

Note that swearing in voice chat is totally fine unless it is making people uncomfortable
Warn Cases (Reason)
Abusing Bugs / Exploits in Hang Out (Abusing Exploits)
Pedophilia Jokes between kids or other inappropriate jokes (Inappropriate Jokes)
Toxic or Inappropriate behavior/language (Toxicity)
False Reporting (False/Malicious Player Reporting)
Mass kicking for no reason (Malicious False Kicking)
In The Lab version Griefing is only a warnable offense (Griefing In Lab)
Maps pasted into wilds that contain any foul language or under detailed penises (Pasting An Inappropriate Map Into Wilds)
Slur Exceptions
If someone uses a slur, and
The person saying it did not know it was a slur AND
it is not directed at a player or used to describe people in general
You should give them a verbal warning instead of an immediate suspension.
 However, you must still track this in the Mod Player Tracking Channel.

If they do it again, or it doesn't meet both requirements, start at 7 days

Remember that if you are unsure what punishment something deserves make sure to communicate with the rest of the mods/ask a senior mod on what to do.
Warn System
We have a new Warning System, which means that if a user is warned 3 times for the same reason or misc, they will get automatically banned.

Right now we have a few different reasons that are grouped:
Hate Speech (racial/cultural hate speech, gender/sexual hate speech, hate speech)
Bullying (bullying, toxic behavior/language)
Abusing bugs (abusing bugs)
Misc (all other reasons, including custom ones
 
*This doesn't apply to Junior Moderators.

If you're a junior and you warn them for a 3rd time, it doesn't ban them.
Protections for Reporters
If someone uses a slur in the context of reporting something that happened to them or another player (example- "Steve said X"), you should give them a verbal warning instead of an immediate suspension, and explain that it's not okay to use that language even when not directed at someone.

If they do this multiple times or are doing it with the intent to push the guidelines, use the normal suspension policies outlined in the guide.
2c. How to Suspend/Warn Players
If you see them in-game:
Record the behavior/creation if possible
If you are pressed for time or the issue is urgent, this is not required - it just makes it easier to explain later
Find their name on the player list
Press the 'Report' button (has ⚠️ on it)
Select how many days you want to ban for
You can also give them a warning instead, which will give them a message and kick them from the game
